The repository contains all code for generating National Transfer Accounts for European countries. NTA combine data from National Accounts and microdata to provide information on income, public transfers, private transfers, consumption and saving by age. 

The compilation of European National Transfer Accounts (ENTA) requires three different types of data: 
1.) Aggregate data from the European System of Accounts
2.) Eurostat microdata inkluding EU-SILC, EUROMOD and the Household Budget Survey
3.) Supplementary data such as population, public consumption and social benefits by COFOG, private consumption by COICOP
